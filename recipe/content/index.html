    <h1> How to Make Madeleines</h1>
    <h2> A French Treat</h2>
    <p>Madeleines are French, shell-shaped cookies. They are crispy on the outside and soft like cake on the inside. This is a quick and easy recipe you will surely love.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Time to Make: 40 Minutes</p>
    <p> Serves: 40 Madeleines</p>
    <br>
    <h3> What You Need </h3> 
    <p>A madeleine mold for baking</p>
    <p>4 eggs</p>
    <p>1 cup sugar</p>
    <p>2 tbsp vanilla extract</p>
    <p>1/2 tsp salt</p>
    <p>2 cups flour</p>
    <p>1 1/4 cup unsalted butter melted</p>
  <br>
    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <p>Prepare all ingredients ahead of time. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.</p>
    <p> In a mixing bowl, whisk together sugar, vanilla extract and eggs. Continue whisking until you get a fluffy texture. </p>
    <p> In small portions, fold the flour into the mixture.  </p>
    <p> In a separate bowl, melt butter and let it cool to room temperature. Add butter to the mixing bowl, carefully folding it in.  </p>

    <h3> Recipe Website References</h3>
<p> One website I liked was <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/">BBC Good Food</a>, since the website was so simple and straight to the point with good organization for types of recipes. A lot of recipe websites have so many ads, videos, or confusing organization so I appreciated the simple heirarchy of this website. </p>
<p> Another recipe website I liked was <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/"> Allrecipes</a>, since it had a really nice simple off-white background with warm colored accents, and was simple. I liked how they organized their buttons with circular images of ingredients or recipes. </p>
<p> My third recipe website was <a href="https://damndelicious.net/"> Damn Delicious</a>, which had a more modern spin on a recipe website. It was more personal, but I loved how the website organizes recipes with those beautiful big images above each recipe, which are also uploaded frequently! The visual heirarchy is so clear and I wanted to keep scrolling.</p>

    <h3> Non-Recipe Website References </h3>
<p> A simple website I like is <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, which has a nice white background with pops of color and images that give it texture and approachability. I don't want an overwhelming design with too much going on, like a lot of recipe websites seem to have.   </p>
<p> Another website I like is <a href="https://www.odysseyinteractive.gg/">Odyssey Interactive</a>, which has bright colors, lures you in with fantastic art, and has very clear navigation, and has images pop up as you scroll. I think the bright colors and effects happening as you scroll is cool and maybe something I would want to try for my recipe website. </p>
<p> And the last website I like is <a href="https://www.saintfriend.co/">Saint Friend </a>, which has pops of color and generally amicable graphics, which I would want to implement as well. I'm doing a French dessert, but I want it to look inviting, simple, and with pops of color.  </p>
