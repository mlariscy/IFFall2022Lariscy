    <h3> Recipe Website References</h3>
<p> One website I liked was <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/">BBC Good Food</a>, since the website was so simple and straight to the point with good organization for types of recipes. A lot of recipe websites have so many ads, videos, or confusing organization so I appreciated the simple heirarchy of this website. </p>
<p> Another recipe website I liked was <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/"> Allrecipes</a>, since it had a really nice simple off-white background with warm colored accents, and was simple. I liked how they organized their buttons with circular images of ingredients or recipes. </p>
<p> My third recipe website was <a href="https://damndelicious.net/"> Damn Delicious</a>, which had a more modern spin on a recipe website. It was more personal, but I loved how the website organizes recipes with those beautiful big images above each recipe, which are also uploaded frequently! The visual heirarchy is so clear and I wanted to keep scrolling.</p>

    <h3> Non-Recipe Website References </h3>
<p> A simple website I like is <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, which has a nice white background with pops of color and images that give it texture and approachability. I don't want an overwhelming design with too much going on, like a lot of recipe websites seem to have.   </p>
<p> Another website I like is <a href="https://www.odysseyinteractive.gg/">Odyssey Interactive</a>, which has bright colors, lures you in with fantastic art, and has very clear navigation, and has images pop up as you scroll. I think the bright colors and effects happening as you scroll is cool and maybe something I would want to try for my recipe website. </p>
<p> And the last website I like is <a href="https://www.saintfriend.co/">Saint Friend </a>, which has pops of color and generally amicable graphics, which I would want to implement as well. I'm doing a French dessert, but I want it to look inviting, simple, and with pops of color.  </p>
