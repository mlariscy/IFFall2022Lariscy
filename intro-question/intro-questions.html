    <h1> Introduction Questions! </h1>

<p> 1) My name is Madeline Lariscy, I'm a junior studying Communication Design. I hope to focus on illustration!</p>

<p> 2) I'm from Atlanta, Georgia! I love digital illustration, and have a really chunky black labrador retreiver at home who I miss dearly. 
Admittedly, I took this class because it is a requirement but I do genuinely think what I learn will be helpful.</p> 

<p>3)  I took a class maybe in 6th grade and don't remember any bit of it, sorry! I'll be starting from scratch. </p>

<p> 4) Since I want to work in the digital art field, the transition from paper to screen is important! I want to learn a bit more
about comfortable viewing sizes and how to size/render images on screens. </p>

<p> 5) Pixel color and image quality drastically change depending on the screen, and I bet checking text size and length will be super important. </p>

<p>  6) I really like the <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> website. It's simple in terms of UI and can be easily changed by the user to best suit their needs. 
    The colors of events can be changed and color coded, and it's always clear what events are going on and going to happen. It also has a tab on the side where you can access other Google widgets, like Google Tasks. I use it personally to track everything and it works great! It's nice to have your calendar and "to do list" accessible within the same app.</p>

<p> 7) A website that I think has effective communication is <a href="https://wustl.instructure.com/ "> WashU's Canvas Page</a>, because it's a very simple design with clear tabs and directions, and only shows you more information the larger you make the window. It's really helpful for finding all of my assignments by having it organized based on topic in lists. The Canvas pages' layouts are largely created by the teachers, but it's simple design is effective in allowing teachers to set up communication and guide students to the resources they need.  </p>


<p>8) A website that works well is <a href="https://www.artstation.com/"> Artstation</a>, which is a professional hub for artists' portfolios. It's easy to access, navigate, and it looks visually professional for a media posting site. I also like that it gives artists lots of viewing options for displaying their own work.  </p>
